<h3>AGONDA BEACH</h3>
<p><img src="WEB places/agonda beach in goa.jpg" align="right" height="200" weight="200"><br></br><b>Agonda beach is a very picturesque beach in South Goa, located between Cola beach and Palolem, which is another popular beach in Goa. Agonda is 70.3 kilometers from Panaji, and 39.2 kilometers from Margao via the NH 66. It is about an hour from Margao and one and half hours from Vasco da Gama. Palolem beach is just 15 minutes away.<br></br>
Agonda is an isolated stretch of sand and a perfect choice for those who want to escape from the busy city lifestyle, everyday routine for a chance to put up their feet and do nothing for a few days. The water is a bit choppy, but it’s perfect for sunbathing and relaxing. There are bars, restaurants, and shacks, but you can find a secluded spot easily. Palolem is a better place for partying, but Agonda is cheaper and hassle-free. There are relatively fewer tourists here, making it a more pristine and quieter beach. This is why it is sometimes called the “ Silent Beach”. You will get a much less “touristic feel” here.</b>

<h3>AGUADA FORT</h3>
<p><img src="WEB places/fort aguada in goa.jpg" align="right" height="200" weight="200"><br></br><b>The Fort Aguada is one of the largest and impressive forts preserved as one of the best known landmarks in Goan history. Its prominence has grown from the fact that its headland on which it is built offers a wonderful site for military architects due to its shielding of the vital sea access from the heart of the Portuguese territory thereby making it an ideal site for seaward as well as landward defense. 
The elimination of the Maratha threat and the acquisition of the New Conquest added more glory to its importance right upto the end of the 18th century when Goa's future borders were established. 
The barrack built by British forces at the beginning of the 19th century during the Napoleonic Wars is no longer visible now.</b>
