<h3>KUMARA PARVATHA</h3>
<p><img src="WEB places/kumara parvatha.jpg" align="right" height="200" weight="200"><br></br><b>If you aren’t very new to the world of trekking then you would have heard the name Kumara Parvata being mentioned often.<br></br>Considered among the toughest treks in South India, It is a perfect mix of physical challenge and natural beauty of the Pushpagiri Wildlife sanctuary.

We start from Bangalore on Friday night and reach Subramanya between 5 and 6 AM on saturday morning. At about 7.30 AM after freshening up, and a quick breakfast, we will proceed to the trailhead, a quarter kilometre long walk away from the Kukke Subramanya temple. A quick introduction and briefing and we begin the first phase of our trek to Bhattara Mane. The trail is a well trod one, and continues for a good 7 kilometers uphill, through thick jungle (Expect leeches in the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons). You know that you're nearing Bhattaramane when the jungle starts growing thinner and the incline becomes less demanding. The trail eventually opens out onto hilly grassland. On an average, this first stretch takes about 3-4 hours to cover.</b>

It is located 8 km from the Madikeri, 122 km from Mysore, 144 km from Mangalore and 268 km from Bangalore.[1]
The river is part of the early reaches of the river Kaveri. Flow is much higher during the monsoon season.<br></br>
The waterfall is located between private coffee plantations with stocky coffee bushes and spice estates with trees entwined with pepper vines. A hanging bridge constructed just opposite the falls.
The falls was earlier called Jessi falls, named after a British officer's wife. sHowever, the place was a thick jungle area back then. Years later, the waterfall was discovered by Mr. Neravanda B.Nanaiah who bought the place from the government and converted it into a coffee and spices plantation that surrounds the waterfall today.</b>
